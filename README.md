# Aisha

Aisha is a solution to managing our server problems, built from scratch with code organization and quality in mind. Our goal is to cover as many functionalities and niches as possible, while still maintaining high quality.

## Built With

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The bot environment
* [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org/#/) - Used to run the bot
* [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) - API server
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Backend (WIP)

## Contributing

**We want everyone to be able to help with Aisha as easily as possible,** so we've created a list with the many ways you can contribute to the project. Take a look, and if you think you can help with any of these, please do! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [join our community server](https://discord.gg/UA6gYhx84m) and ask as many questions as you want.

### Ideas and discussion

Have an awesome idea for a new command? We'd love to hear about it, no matter how silly you think it is. For us, no idea is a bad idea, so please [open an issue](https://github.com/rifqisah/aisha/issues/new) describing what you have in mind. We'll discuss it and, quite possibly, add it to the bot!

### Writing code

If you know how to code in Typescript, then feel free to give one of the existent ideas a try. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/rifqisah/aisha/fork), make some changes and then open a pull request! We don't really have much documentation on how the bot ecosystem works, but you should be able to get it with a quick look under the hood.

> âš  **Please don't open Pull Requests with features that haven't been discussed as issues yet.** We don't want you to waste time writing a feature that might get denied. If you have an idea and want it to be in the bot, check the [Ideas and discussion](#ideas-and-discussion) paragraph above.

### Reporting bugs

Found something crashes the bot? Something isn't working like intended? Please let us know! Whenever you find a bug flying around, [try using one of these](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pedrofracassi/fa560c3932eb4438e6033203cc8058bc/raw/37440ba7d730a9c539865f72ebc9992eb32d6b7e/bug.jpg). If that doesn't work, don't hesitate to [write a bug report](https://github.com/rifqisah/aisha/issues/new?template=BUG.md). Please give us as much information as you can, preferably filling all of the fields provided on the template.

## Self-hosting

**We ask you to please not host your own instance of Aisha.** Even though our license allows it, self-hosted instances of the bot have brought us a lot of headache in the past. If you're considering self-hosting, please try the official instance of the bot first. If you have any concerns about the security of our instance, please contact us. We'd love to talk and answer any questions you have.

> If you're really really really going to self-host the bot, please [read our license](https://github.com/RifqiSah/Aisha/blob/master/LICENSE.md) first, and be aware that we don't provide any self-hosting support. **You'll be on your own.**
